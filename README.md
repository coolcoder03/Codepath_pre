### App Idea: Event Collaborator

I have an idea for an app called "Event Collaborator." This app is designed to help users collaboratively plan and organize events with their friends and colleagues. Users can create events, set dates, and invite participants. One key feature is a shared to-do list for each event, where participants can add tasks, mark them as complete, and discuss details. Another feature is a shared calendar where all event-related dates are displayed, helping attendees stay on top of event preparations. Additionally, the app will have a messaging feature to facilitate communication within the event group. The ability to customize event themes and colors would add a fun and personal touch to each event's planning process. While the core concept revolves around collaborative event planning, incorporating social media sharing and integration with existing calendar apps could enhance its usability.
